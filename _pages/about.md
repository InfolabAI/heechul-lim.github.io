## Introduction

Hello! I am ***Heechul Lim***, a Ph.D. holder in AI with extensive research and industrial experience across **Anomaly Detection**, **Computer Vision**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **AutoML**. I have published several papers in top-tier journals (SCIE, JCR top 5.2%) and international conferences, and hold multiple patents related to deep learning acceleration and neural architecture search. Currently, I work as a **Senior Research Engineer at LG Electronics**, integrating advanced anomaly detection and test-time adaptation into manufacturing processes. Previously at **Samsung Electronics**, I led innovative projects in mobile forensics and data analytics, earning prestigious awards from both the President and Executive Vice President.

My core research interests encompass **distribution shift**, **vision-and-language pretraining (VLP)**, **prompt engineering**, and **efficient architecture search**. I am also skilled in **GAN-based active learning**, **weakly supervised learning**, **graph neural networks**, and **PyTorch**. Committed to bridging cutting-edge research with real-world solutions, I welcome any collaboration ideas or questions you may have!
