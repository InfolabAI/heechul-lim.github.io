## Introduction
Hello! I am Heechul Lim, a Ph.D. holder in AI with extensive research and industrial experience across Anomaly Detection, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and AutoML. My most recent works—currently under review at ICCV 2025—focus on advancing anomaly detection via reverse distillation with coreset learning for efficient multi-class inspection and Segment Anything Model (SAM)-based prompt learning with multi-level noise and soft labels. These studies aim to significantly reduce memory usage, improve training stability, and enhance defect localization accuracy in real-world industrial environments.

I have published several papers in top-tier journals (SCIE, JCR top 5.2%) and international conferences, and hold multiple patents related to deep learning acceleration and neural architecture search. Currently, I work as a Senior Research Engineer at LG Electronics, integrating state-of-the-art anomaly detection and test-time adaptation into manufacturing processes. Previously at Samsung Electronics, I led innovative projects in mobile forensics and data analytics, earning prestigious awards from both the President and Executive Vice President.

My core research interests include distribution shift, vision-and-language pretraining (VLP), prompt engineering, and efficient architecture search. I am also experienced in GAN-based active learning, weakly supervised learning, and PyTorch. Committed to bridging cutting-edge research with real-world solutions, I welcome any collaboration ideas or questions you may have!
